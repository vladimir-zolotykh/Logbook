Dear Mr. Graham Hancock

In your edited version of "The Fingerprints of the Gods" you quote Mr. Charles Hapgood:

"The general shape of the continent was startlingly like the outline of the continent on our modern maps.
The position of the South Pole nearly in the centre of the continent seemed about right."

It was said about the Oronteus Finaeus 1531 map.

I understand that there are only two ice caps on a planet in solar system, Earth including. 
They located on the poles, only there Ace age is going. 
If the region or continent has been mapped, it could only have been done when it was in ice free condition and thus not a pole. 

Still we have a map of Antarctica with a right place of the "South Pole". It could be explained either:

1) The survey was done after it become a pole and before it was completely covered by thick ice. 
   It seems unlikely, we know the disasters so dramatic change produces and how much time it requires to overcome the consequences.

2) There was epochs (very long ones) on Earth when there were no ice caps at all.

It could not be mapped when the continent was located some distance from the true pole, 
because the position of the South Pole would have been somewhere else.

The question is: how the South Pole region or North Pole one could ever be mapped at all 
unless ice caps not existed at all or our ancestors had the technology to "see" under ice.
